## Introduction
The WholeBrainedIntelligence (WBI) system is designed to emulate various cognitive processes by integrating multiple specialized modules. It aims to advance artificial intelligence capabilities through a comprehensive approach that mirrors human cognition. This project is based on the Unified Theory of Mind (UTOM) and incorporates modules for self-awareness, heuristic pattern recognition, counterfactual simulation, value affection, empathic interaction, and learning from experience.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Git
- Virtual environment tool (e.g., `venv`, `virtualenv`)
- Required libraries (listed in `requirements.txt`)

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/QuantaScriptor/WholeBrainedIntelligence_WBI.git
    cd WholeBrainedIntelligence_WBI
    ```

2. Set up the virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Configure the environment:
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add necessary environment variables.

5. Run the initial setup script:
    ```bash
    python setup.py
    ```

## Usage
Initialize the WBI system and use its modules:

```python
from wbi import WBI

wbi_system = WBI()
wbi_system.self_awareness.monitor_state()
wbi_system.heuristic_pattern_recognition.detect_patterns(data)
wbi_system.counterfactual_simulation.simulate_scenarios(current_state)
wbi_system.value_affection.evaluate_values(outcomes)
wbi_system.empathic_interaction.recognize_emotions(text)
wbi_system.learning_from_experience.collect_experiences()
```

## Modules
- **Self-Awareness Module**: Provides self-monitoring and reflective capabilities.
- **Heuristic Pattern Recognition Module**: Detects patterns and anomalies in data.
- **Counterfactual Simulation Module**: Simulates alternate scenarios for decision-making.
- **Value Affection Module**: Evaluates and assigns value to outcomes.
- **Empathic Interaction Module**: Facilitates empathetic responses and interactions.
- **Learning from Experience Module**: Enhances learning from past experiences.

## Examples
Refer to the `examples` directory for comprehensive examples of using the WBI system.
