## Overview

WholeBrainedIntelligence (WBI) aims to push the boundaries of AI by creating a system that mimics the integrative cognitive faculties of the human brain. By incorporating modules for self-awareness, heuristic pattern recognition, counterfactual simulation, emotional intelligence, and social cognition, WBI represents a holistic approach to artificial general intelligence.

## Key Features

- **Integrative Cognitive Architecture**: Combines neural networks with symbolic reasoning for seamless data-driven and logic-based tasks.
- **Emotional Intelligence**: Real-time emotional recognition and adaptive response.
- **Consciousness Emulation**: Self-reflective capabilities through a meta-cognition layer.
- **Dynamic Creativity Engine**: Generates innovative ideas using advanced generative models.
- **Advanced Social Cognition**: Enhanced social interactions with Theory of Mind and interactive narratives.
- **Bio-Inspired Learning**: Efficient learning processes inspired by biological systems.
- **Ethical and Transparent AI**: Operates with high ethical standards and transparency.
- **Distributed Computing**: Scalable performance with multi-GPU support.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Automated optimization for better model performance.
- **Self-Supervised Learning**: Improved learning from unlabeled data.
- **Meta-Learning**: Adaptable to new tasks with minimal data.
- **NLP Enhancement**: Advanced language processing capabilities.
- **Reinforcement Learning**: Integration of adaptive decision-making.

## Installation

1. **Clone the repository**:
   
### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Git
- Virtual environment tool (e.g., `venv`, `virtualenv`)
- Required libraries (listed in `requirements.txt`)

### Steps
1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/QuantaScriptor/WholeBrainedIntelligence_WBI.git
    cd WholeBrainedIntelligence_WBI
    ```

2. Set up the virtual environment:
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `venv\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4. Configure the environment:
    Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add necessary environment variables.

5. Run the initial setup script:
    ```bash
    python setup.py
    ```

## Usage
Initialize the WBI system and use its modules:

```python
from wbi import WBI

wbi_system = WBI()
wbi_system.self_awareness.monitor_state()
wbi_system.heuristic_pattern_recognition.detect_patterns(data)
wbi_system.counterfactual_simulation.simulate_scenarios(current_state)
wbi_system.value_affection.evaluate_values(outcomes)
wbi_system.empathic_interaction.recognize_emotions(text)
wbi_system.learning_from_experience.collect_experiences()
```

## Modules
- **Self-Awareness Module**: Provides self-monitoring and reflective capabilities.
- **Heuristic Pattern Recognition Module**: Detects patterns and anomalies in data.
- **Counterfactual Simulation Module**: Simulates alternate scenarios for decision-making.
- **Value Affection Module**: Evaluates and assigns value to outcomes.
- **Empathic Interaction Module**: Facilitates empathetic responses and interactions.
- **Learning from Experience Module**: Enhances learning from past experiences.

## Examples
