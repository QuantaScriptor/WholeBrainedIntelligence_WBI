## Getting Started
For setup and usage instructions, refer to the documentation in the `docs/` directory.

```sh
# Contents 

- [Setup](docs/setup.md) - Prerequisites and installation instructions.
- [Usage](docs/usage.md) - Provides examples and information on how to use the system.
```

## Overview

Whole-Brained Intelligence (WBI) aims to push the boundaries of AI by creating a system that mimics the integrative cognitive faculties of the human brain. By incorporating modules for self-awareness, heuristic pattern recognition, counterfactual simulation, emotional intelligence, and social cognition, WBI represents a holistic approach to artificial general intelligence.

```sh
# Key Features

- **Integrative Cognitive Architecture**: Combines neural networks with symbolic reasoning for seamless data-driven and logic-based tasks.
- **Emotional Intelligence**: Real-time emotional recognition and adaptive response.
- **Consciousness Emulation**: Self-reflective capabilities through a meta-cognition layer.
- **Dynamic Creativity Engine**: Generates innovative ideas using advanced generative models.
- **Advanced Social Cognition**: Enhanced social interactions with Theory of Mind and interactive narratives.
- **Bio-Inspired Learning**: Efficient learning processes inspired by biological systems.
- **Ethical and Transparent AI**: Operates with high ethical standards and transparency.
- **Distributed Computing**: Scalable performance with multi-GPU support.
- **Hyperparameter Tuning**: Automated optimization for better model performance.
- **Self-Supervised Learning**: Improved learning from unlabeled data.
- **Meta-Learning**: Adaptable to new tasks with minimal data.
- **NLP Enhancement**: Advanced language processing capabilities.
```

## Installation
```sh
1. Python 3.8 or higher
2. GIT repository clone https://github.com/QuantaScriptor/WholeBrainedIntelligence_WBI.git
